    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I like to prep my food. It takes some of the stress out of having home cooked food available over the course of the week. My favorite choice of prepped foods is a tasty burrito. I don't need anything fancy when it comes to a good burrito so I keep it simple with rice, beans, cheese, and maybe some beef or chicken.</p>

    <p>To make my life even easier, I use an instant pot to cook most of the ingredients. If you don't own an instant pot, good luck. This resiple makes roughly fifteen to twenty small burritos that can easily be frozen or kept in the fridge. I like to reheat these on the stove to get some nice crisp to the tortilla but a microwave or oven works well too.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Black beans</li>
        <li>Brown basmati rice</li>
        <li>Shredded Cheese(pick your favorite)</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Red enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>Medium tortillas</li>
        <li>Aluminum foil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>using an instant pot</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 500g of black beans with 750ml of water into the instant pot and use the beans setting</li>
        <li>Once done, strain the beans into a container and let cool in the fridge</li>
        <li>After you have a fresh pof for your instant pot, add 500g of rice with a 1000ml of water. The rice setting is wondrous.</li>
        <li>Like the beans, put your rice in a container and let it cool in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Final piece of the puzzle for the instant pot. Put your ground beef and enchilada sauce into the instant pot and utilize the meat setting.</li>
        <li>Once all of your ingredients have cooled, assemble your burritos inside the medium tortillas and wrap them in the Aluminum Foil.</li>
        <li>Freeze or refridgerate!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I like to eat these with Valentina sauce. Enjoy!</p>
