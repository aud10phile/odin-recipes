    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I like to prep my food. It takes some of the stress out of having home cooked food available over the course of the week. My favorite choice of prepped foods is a tasty burrito. I don't need anything fancy when it comes to a good burrito so I keep it simple with rice, beans, cheese, and maybe some beef or chicken.</p>

    <p>To make my life even easier, I use an instant pot to cook most of the ingredients. If you don't own an instant pot, good luck. This resiple makes roughly fifteen to twenty small burritos that can easily be frozen or kept in the fridge. I like to reheat these on the stove to get some nice crisp to the tortilla but a microwave or oven works well too.</p>
