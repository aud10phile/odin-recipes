    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My morning usually consists of a big smoothie to start my day. It helps get a good couple servings of greens (especially the leafy ones) and I can get fruit in there as well. This is a recipe that I started making while on a gut reset program and it was the quick and easy solution to having breakfast on the go.</p>

    <p>I use a somewhat high powered blender for this and I would recommend having something along those lines for your ease of mind. I also tried making something similar before this blender and it did not go well. RIP. I also have all of my ingredients frozen (save the coconut milk and collagen powder), this saves me from having to add ice cubes which dilutes the taste.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Power greens(think kale, spinach, chard)</li>
        <li>Berry blend(I like to have strawberries in the mix because they add sweetness)</li>
        <li>Collagen powder</li>
        <li>Coconut milk(something with no added sugar)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure out your greens to roughly 2 cups</li>
        <li>Add the greens to the blender</li>
        <li>Add coconut milk to the top of the greens</li>
        <li>Scoop your collagen powder on top of the greens and milk</li>
        <li>Put one final cup of greens on top and to top it off, add your berries.</li>
        <li>To give a good consistency, have your coconut milk to the top of the berries</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I have a special button that I discovered while making these smoothies. If you have an "extract" button, use it. You won't be sorry.</p>
