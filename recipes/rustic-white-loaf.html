        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for a basic white loaf of bread in a <em>rustic style</em>. I started the loaf in a stand mixer but it is also easy to start by hand, on the counter, the old fashioned way. I took this recipe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hollywood">Paul Hollywood's</a> book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Hollywood-100-Great-Breads/dp/1788402146/ref=asc_df_1788402146/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459706669091&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4863611894163309432&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9029597&hvtargid=pla-918995010709&psc=1"><em>100 Great Breads</em></a> but like most recipes that I bake, I modify them. I would say the main modification for this recipe is the "rustic" look of the loaf. I've made this recipe in a tin previously and it makes delicious sandwich bread.</p>

        <p>Some other things to note. I like my bread salty. A nice salty finish to a bread is something that really excites me (maybe I have a problem). If you don't like a salty bread, I would use Unsalted butter. As you'll see in the instructions, I don't activate my yeast before putting it into the dough. This means that having room temperature <strong><em>everything</em></strong> will not slow down your initial rise. With that, here is what I used as ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g White Bread Flour</li>
            <li>270ml Water (Room Temperature)</li>
            <li>57g Salted Butter (Softened)</li>
            <li>10g Salt</li>
            <li>10g Active Dry Yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by combining all of dry ingredients in the mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn your stand mixer on low (or start digging in with your hands) and slowly add your softened butter.</li>
            <li>Now slowly add your water and mix until all ingredients are no longer sticking to the side of the mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>At this point, you have two options. Start your proof or be like me and turn out your dough onto your table and knead until you're satisfied with the gluten structure.</li>
            <li>Let your dough rise for an hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Prep a Banneton(or proofing basket) with a bit of flour.</li>
            <li>With the dough risen, take it out of the bowl and press out some of the air that has built up.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into an appropriate shape by </li>
        </ol>
